### Current solutions to problems
| Problem | Solution |
| - | - |
| Individuals face difficulties finding DOST-relevant information scattered across multiple sources | By developing a chatbot for Facebook Messenger, the most widely used communication platform in the Philippines, we can centralize information access. This approach will reach a broader audience, including those with slower internet connections or limited technological skills, providing a single, comprehensive source of information. |
| The information available is not personalized or easily understood without additional explanation | The chatbot can be trained or integrated with DOST documents and information to address specific queries. It will provide tailored explanations and guide users through processes, reducing frustration and confusion while preventing missed opportunities. |
| Not everyone speaks or understands English, particularly those who need help the most | By utilizing a multilingual language model, the chatbot can interact in various languages, making DOST processes, programs, scholarships, and services accessible to non-English speakers. |

| The need to maintain multiple online support channels (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, YouTube) alongside the chatbot | The chatbot will use Browser Automation *(Puppeteer)* to manage interactions on Facebook and can be extended to other websites and services. This enables centralized automation of multiple support channels from a local server, enhancing security and efficiency. |
| Manual and repetitive tasks in processing and managing documents, programs, scholarships, and student information | The chatbot, as a server, can handle repetitive or management tasks, assisting students, faculty, and teachers. This will free up time for improving services and providing more focused support. |
